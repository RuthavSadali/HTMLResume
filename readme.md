# HTML Resume Project

For this assignment you're going to create a resume for yourself in HTML. It can either be a resume looking for a job or for applying to colleges. 

You're going to commit and push several versions. The first will be just basic HTML and have no styling. Later we'll talk about styling with CSS and you'll improve your resume and make it look better.

Your resume needs to include:
* Your name. Should be in a level 1 header tag.
* An image. Can be a placeholder image if you don't want to include a picture of yourself. 
* The following sections in level 2 header tags. Use an unordered list for each line item under each section.
  * Contact - Must include phone and email (can be fake). The email address should be hyperlinked. 
  * Education - Include a link to the SLHS website
  * Experience - Would be a good place to include a link to your GitHub profile
  * Awards, etc - List other things that would make you a good candidate. Might also want to link to any of your GitHub repos that you're particularly proud of.
